Based on the provided action trajectory, here are the useful strategies to effectively query map websites:

1. Search Query Refinement:
- Start with a broad search term (e.g., "Apple Store") if specific queries don't yield results
- Expand abbreviations to full names (e.g., "Upitt" to "University of Pittsburgh")
- Include city names for better localization (e.g., "Apple Store Pittsburgh")

2. Map Navigation:
- Use zoom in/out functions to adjust the view scope
- Zoom out to get a broader perspective when specific locations aren't immediately visible
- Zoom in to see more detailed location information in a specific area

3. Iterative Search Approach:
- If initial search fails, try alternative search terms
- Progress from specific to general queries or vice versa
- Make multiple search attempts with different combinations of keywords

4. Results Examination:
- Review search results list for relevant locations
- Check detailed location information from search results
- Look for coordinates or address details in the location information

5. Location Verification:
- Cross-reference results with known landmarks or reference points
- Confirm the location is in the desired area
- Check that the found location matches the search criteria

These strategies help ensure thorough and accurate location searches on map websites.
