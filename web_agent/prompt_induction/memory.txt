Based on the action trajectory, here are the key strategies for effectively querying map websites to find locations and directions:

1. Use the Appropriate Search Function:
- For simple location searches, use the main search bar
- For getting directions between two points, use the dedicated "Find directions" functionality

2. Input Location Details:
- Use complete, formal names instead of abbreviations (e.g., "University of Pittsburgh" instead of "Upitt")
- Include specific street names when available (e.g., "Starbucks Craig Street")
- Add city names if searching in a specific area

3. Configure Transportation Settings:
- Select the appropriate transportation mode (Car, Bicycle, Foot) based on your needs
- Click on the label/icon rather than the radio button itself for better interaction
- Make sure to set this before calculating the route

4. Search Refinement:
- Start with specific searches first
- If no results are found, broaden the search terms
- Add more location context if initial search is unsuccessful

5. Navigation Tips:
- Use the "Go" button after entering search terms
- Wait for the route to be calculated
- Look for key information in the results like distance and time
- Zoom in/out on the map as needed to better view locations

These strategies help ensure accurate and efficient location finding and route planning on map websites.
