Use the information about the engineers to find out how many nurses stayed.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of people initially.**\n\nThe initial number of engineers is 32, and the initial number of nurses is 73. Therefore, the total number of people is:\n\\[ 32 + 73 = 105 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many people left the meeting.**\n\nFour-sixths of the total number of people left. So, we calculate:\n\\[ \\frac{4}{6} \\times 105 = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 105 = 70 \\]\nSo, 70 people left the meeting.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of engineers who left.**\n\nWe know that 30 engineers stayed at the meeting. Therefore, the number of engineers who left is:\n\\[ 32 - 30 = 2 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Determine how many nurses stayed.**\n\nSince 70 people left in total and 2 of them were engineers, the number of nurses who left is:\n\\[ 70 - 2 = 68 \\]\nTherefore, the number of nurses who stayed is:\n\\[ 73 - 68 = 5 \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]"], "eval": {"accuracy": 1.0}, "output": ["5"]}], "current_loop": 1}
