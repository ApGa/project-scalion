Since this information is not provided in the problem statement, I'll assume hypothetical times for the sake of reasoning.\n\nLet's assume:\n- It takes Valeria 30 minutes to solve one jigsaw puzzle.\n- It takes Valeria 15 minutes to solve one brain teaser.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total time step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the time spent on jigsaw puzzles:\n   - Time per jigsaw puzzle = 30 minutes\n   - Number of jigsaw puzzles = 2\n   - Total time for jigsaw puzzles = 30 minutes/puzzle * 2 puzzles = 60 minutes\n\n2. Calculate the time spent on brain teasers:\n   - Time per brain teaser = 15 minutes\n   - Number of brain teasers = 8\n   - Total time for brain teasers = 15 minutes/teaser * 8 teasers = 120 minutes\n\n3. Add the time spent on jigsaw puzzles and brain teasers to get the total time:\n   - Total time = Time for jigsaw puzzles + Time for brain teasers\n   - Total time = 60 minutes + 120 minutes = 180 minutes\n\nTherefore, the total time Valeria spent solving 2 jigsaw puzzles and 8 brain teasers is \\boxed{180} minutes."], "eval": {"accuracy": 0.0}, "output": ["180"]}], "current_loop": 1}
