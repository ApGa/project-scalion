This means that about 80-90% of the kernels will pop into popcorn.\n\n3. **Consider Residual Heat Effects**: Sometimes, residual heat can cause a few more kernels to pop after the initial popping, but this effect is usually minimal and varies widely depending on the specific conditions.\n\n4. **Calculate Final Popcorn Pieces**: Using the popping efficiency, calculate the expected number of popped kernels.

The popcorn kernels start to pop at a constant rate of 20 kernels per second for the first 30 seconds.\n2. After 30 seconds, the rate decreases linearly to 0 kernels per second over the next 10 seconds.\n3. No additional kernels pop after the pan is removed from the heat.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Determine the number of kernels that pop in the first 30 seconds:**\n   - Rate of popping = 20 kernels/second\n   - Time = 30 seconds\n   - Number of kernels popped in 30 seconds = \\(20 \\text{ kernels/second} \\times 30 \\text{ seconds} = 600 \\text{ kernels}\\)\n\n2. **Determine the number of kernels that pop in the next 10 seconds:**\n   - The rate decreases linearly from 20 kernels/second to 0 kernels/second over 10 seconds.\n   - The average rate during this period is \\(\\frac{20 + 0}{2} = 10\\) kernels/second.\n   - Time = 10 seconds\n   - Number of kernels popped in the next 10 seconds = \\(10 \\text{ kernels/second} \\times 10 \\text{ seconds} = 100 \\text{ kernels}\\)\n\n3. **Total number of kernels that pop:**\n   - Total number of kernels popped = Kernels popped in first 30 seconds + Kernels popped in next 10 seconds\n   - Total number of kernels popped = 600 + 100 = 700 kernels\n\n4. **Time taken for all kernels to pop:**\n   - Total time = 30 seconds (first period) + 10 seconds (second period) = 40 seconds\n\n5. **Additional kernels that pop after the pan is removed from the heat:**\n   - According to our assumption, no additional kernels pop after the pan is removed from the heat.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe popcorn kernels pop at a rate of 20 kernels per second for the first 30 seconds, then at a decreasing rate until the last 10 seconds when they pop at an average rate of 10 kernels per second.

Let's assume the popcorn kernels start popping immediately when the heat is applied and continue to pop for 30 seconds.\n2. Let's assume the rate at which the kernels pop is constant, with 50% of the kernels popping in the first 15 seconds and the remaining 50% popping in the next 15 seconds.\n3.

However, some kernels may not pop immediately due to various factors such as being undercooked or having too much moisture.\n\n3. **Residual popping**: After the initial popping, some unpopped kernels may continue to pop at a slower rate due to residual heat or if they are still in contact with the hot air or surface for a while. This is known as \"residual popping.\"\n\n4. **Estimate residual popping rate**: The exact rate of residual popping can vary, but it is generally a small fraction of the total number of kernels. For simplicity, let's assume that about 5% of the unpopped kernels will continue to pop after being removed from the heat.\n\n5. **Calculate the number of residual popped kernels**: If 5% of the unpopped kernels continue to pop, then the number of residual popped kernels would be \\( 0.05N \\).\n\n6. **Total number of popped kernels**: The total number of popped kernels would be the sum of the initially popped kernels and the residual popped kernels.

However, I'll provide a general framework for reasoning through such a problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Determine the Popping Rate:**\n   - Let's assume the rate at which popcorn kernels pop is given in terms of the number of kernels that pop per second or per minute. For example, if 10 kernels pop every 5 seconds, the popping rate would be 2 kernels per second.\n\n2. **Total Number of Kernels:**\n   - Suppose there are \\( N \\) popcorn kernels in the pot initially.\n\n3. **Time to Pop All Kernels:**\n   - If the popping rate is \\( r \\) kernels per second, the time \\( t \\) it takes to pop all \\( N \\) kernels can be calculated using the formula:\n     \\[\n     t = \\frac{N}{r} \\text{ seconds}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Additional Pieces After Removing Heat:**\n   - After the pot is removed from the heat, some kernels may continue to pop due to residual heat. The number of additional kernels that pop after the heat is removed depends on the specific conditions (e.g., temperature of the pot, duration of residual heat). Let's denote this additional number of popped kernels as \\( A \\).\n\n### Example Calculation:\n\nLet's assume:\n- There are 100 kernels in the pot.\n- The popping rate is 5 kernels per second.\n- After the pot is removed from heat, an additional 10 kernels pop.\n\nUsing the above formulas:\n\n1. **Popping Time:**\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{100 \\text{ kernels}}{5 \\text{ kernels/second}} = 20 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Additional Pieces After Removing Heat:**\n   \\[\n   A = 10 \\text{ kernels}\n   \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe popcorn kernels pop at a rate of 5 kernels per second, taking 20 seconds to pop all 100 kernels. After the pot is removed from heat, an additional 10 kernels pop.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{20 \\text{ seconds}, 5 \\text{ kernels/second}, 10 \\text{ additional kernels}}\n\\]\n\nThis is a hypothetical scenario based on assumed values.

A common assumption for popping rates is that kernels pop at a rate of about 5-10 seconds per kernel. For simplicity, let's assume an average popping rate of 7.5 seconds per kernel.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total Time for Kernels to Pop\nIf we have \\( n \\) kernels in the pot, the total time for all kernels to pop can be calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Total time} = n \\times 7.5 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine When the Pot is Removed from Heat\nThe pot is typically removed from heat once most of the kernels have popped.

Compute the total cost of the additional plants.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Space Occupied by Existing Plants\n\nEach plant occupies 7 meters, and there is a 13-meter gap between each plant. For 11 plants, there are 10 gaps between them.\n\n- Total space occupied by plants = \\(11 \\times 7\\) meters\n- Total space occupied by gaps = \\(10 \\times 13\\) meters\n\nSo, the total space occupied by the existing 11 plants is:\n\\[11 \\times 7 + 10 \\times 13 = 77 + 130 = 207 \\text{ meters}\\]\n\nHowever, Nadia's flower bed is only 156 meters long.

We need to check if they fit within the first part of the bed.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Remaining Space\n\nIf we assume the first 11 plants fit within the 156 meters, we need to recalculate the space occupied by the first 11 plants correctly.\n\nFor the first 11 plants:\n- The first plant takes up 7 meters.\n- There are 10 gaps of 13 meters each between the plants.\n\nTotal space for the first 11 plants:\n\\[7 + 10 \\times 13 = 7 + 130 = 137 \\text{ meters}\\]\n\nThis fits within the 156 meters, so we proceed with this calculation.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Remaining Space for Additional Plants\n\nThe remaining space after placing the first 11 plants is:\n\\[156 - 137 = 19 \\text{ meters}\\]\n\nEach new plant requires 7 meters of space, and we need to account for the 13-meter gap after each plant.\n\n### Step 4: Determine How Many More Plants Can Fit\n\nWe need to find out how many more plants can fit in the remaining 19 meters.
