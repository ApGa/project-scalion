Then, the capacity of Jamal's phone is \\(6B\\).\n   - We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, so \\(6B = 1800\\).\n   - Solving for \\(B\\), we get \\(B = \\frac{1800}{6} = 300\\).\n\n3. **Determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph:**\n   - Since the capacity of Brittany's phone (which can hold 5000 photographs) is not directly relevant to the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, we focus on the given information about Jamal's phone.\n   - The problem does not provide a direct relationship between the number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold and the number of ducks in his photograph. However, it implies that the capacity of Jamal's phone (1800 photographs) is related to the number of ducks in his photograph, but no specific ratio or additional information is provided to directly link these two quantities.\n\nGiven the information provided, we can infer that the problem might be asking us to find the number of ducks based on the capacity of Jamal's phone alone, which is 1800 photographs. Without additional context or a specific ratio linking the number of photographs to the number of ducks, we cannot determine the exact number of ducks from the given data.\n\nHowever, if we assume that each photograph taken by Jamal represents one duck (a common simplification in such problems without additional details), then the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph would be equal to the number of photographs his phone can hold, which is 1800.\n\nThus, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is \\(\\boxed{1800}\\)."], "eval": {"accuracy": 0.0}, "output": ["1800"]}], "current_loop": 1}
