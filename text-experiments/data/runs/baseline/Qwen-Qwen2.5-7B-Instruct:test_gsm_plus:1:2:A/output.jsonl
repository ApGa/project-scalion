Since the total length of the ribbon remains 100 cm and it is divided into 20 equal parts (4 parts * 5 smaller parts each), the length of each final piece is:\n\\[ \\frac{100 \\text{ cm}}{20} = 5 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nEach final cut is made on these 5 cm segments, but the question asks for the length of each final cut in terms of the original ribbon, which is not directly relevant to the length of the final pieces. The length of each final cut itself is not specified in the problem, only the number of cuts and their timing.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"How long will each final cut be?\" is not applicable as the length of the cut itself is not provided or required to solve the problem.
